# XBee 802.15.4 Tutorial Code
This code is written for a blog tutorial on writing code to commmunicate using Python and Arduino using XBee 802.15.4 radios configured in API mode.  Find the tutorial at [serdmanczyk.github.io](http://serdmanczyk.github.io/development/blog/XBeeAPI-PythonArduino-Tutorial/)

## Python
This directory contains all Python code.  The only requirement is the [pySerial](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/) library.  It is written for Python 2.7 and Python 3.3

## Arduino
This directory contains a full Arduino project programmed for Arduino Uno.  Simply load the .ino file in the Arduino Software, compile, and upload.
